#You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
#Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
#Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
#Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
#Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
#From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#1. Merge the training and the test data.

#reading the data general and training.

subject_train <- read.table("./train/subject_train.txt")
subject_test <- read.table("./test/subject_test.txt")
X_train <- read.table("./train/X_train.txt")
X_test <- read.table("./test/X_test.txt")
y_train <- read.table("./train/y_train.txt")
y_test <- read.table("./test/y_test.txt")

#Assign column names to the data above.

names(subject_train) <- "subjectID"
names(subject_test) <- "subjectID"
featureNames <- read.table("features.txt")
names(X_train) <- featureNames$V2
names(X_test) <- featureNames$V2
names(y_train) <- "activity"
names(y_test) <- "activity"
#Merging training Data...

train <- cbind(subject_train, y_train, X_train)
test <- cbind(subject_test, y_test, X_test)
combined <- rbind(train, test)
## STEP 2: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard
## deviation for each measurement.

# determine which columns contain "mean()" or "std()"
meanstdcols <- grepl("mean\\(\\)", names(combined)) |
  grepl("std\\(\\)", names(combined))

# ensure that we also keep the subjectID and activity columns
meanstdcols[1:2] <- TRUE

# remove unnecessary columns
combined <- combined[, meanstdcols]


## STEP 3: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities
## in the data set.
## STEP 4: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive
## activity names. 

# convert the activity column from integer to factor
combined$activity <- factor(combined$activity, labels=c("Walking","Walking Upstairs", "Walking Downstairs", "Sitting", "Standing", "Laying"))


## STEP 5: Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the
## average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# create the tidy data set
melted <- melt(combined, id=c("subjectID","activity"))
tidy <- dcast(melted, subjectID+activity ~ variable, mean)

# write the tidy data set to a file
write.csv(tidy, "tidy.csv", row.names=FALSE)
